# Django - creating API - Tests

## About
This repository is my fifteenth homework assignment from the Python Pro course. This is my first introduction to the Django framework.
I will make web-site that calls pet-shelter. Tha main idea for this site is to allow users to schedule visits with animals in a shelter. 
The platform enables potential adopters to browse available pets and book appointments to meet them in person.

Main task in this repo is to create unit tests for the schedule_calculations.py in animals app folder

Added some functional to the apps, like:
- Adedd test.py to the apps folders
- test.py cheking vies.py endpoints
